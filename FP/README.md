The user can move between questions and can submit his answers once all the questions have been answered. The button changes depending on the question number the user is on, for example the previous button disappearing for the first question and the next button disappearing for the final question and being replace by the submit button. The questions are presented one after the other by editing their CSS style through JavaScript to only show when the relevant question number is present.

The leaderboard is generated by iterating through the scores table in the database and retrieving the scores of all the users and sorts them by descending order. The user can retry the quiz from this page , if he does so he will be redirected to the homepage. If the same user plays again the score is updated if the score is higher than the user's current best
